# GUI helper for my p5js projects

More information soon.

## Usage

For now you can see examples in this repository:

- [Simple GUI](../../crazy/)
- [Input of files](../../divide/)
- [Lots of controls](../../blot-painting/)

## Is this stable?

Should be stable enough, but use at your own risk. With this I mean I may break the API at some point in the future if I see a potential simplification of the code.

## Tests

[See tests here](tests/tests.html)
